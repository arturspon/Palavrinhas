# Palavrinhas

Palavrinhas is a Wordle clone built with Vue 3, but with a multiplayer mode.  
It works like this: you click to play a multiplayer match and then send the link to your friend. Your friend joins the match and the person that guesses the word first wins.  

During the match, you can the other player moves in real time.

## Stack

Originally I made Palavrinhas with Vue 2, but after a while I decided to migrate to Vue 3.  
The multiplayer part is made with Firebase Firestore.
